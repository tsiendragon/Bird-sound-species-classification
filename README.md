Bird Species Detection by Sound
# Introduction
This project is aimed at training a machine learning model to detect different bird species by analyzing their sounds. The trained model can be used to automate the process of bird species identification, which can be very useful for bird watchers, ornithologists, and other wildlife enthusiasts.

# Dataset
The first step in this project is to collect a dataset of bird sounds that can be used to train the machine learning model. There are several websites and databases available online that provide a large collection of bird sounds, such as Xeno-canto, the Macaulay Library at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, and the British Library Sounds.

Once the dataset is collected, it needs to be preprocessed and labeled. This involves extracting features from the audio files, such as frequency, amplitude, and duration, and labeling each audio file with the corresponding bird species.

# Machine Learning Model
## Transfer learning
We use the pre-train speed self supervised pre-train model which is public released here: [WavLM](https://github.com/microsoft/unilm/tree/master/wavlm).

To fine-tune for audio classification, we could follow the example here:
[Audio Classification](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/examples/pytorch/audio-classification/run_audio_classification.py)

## Finetune methods
To efficiently finetune the methods, we utilize the method in [Learnable memory ViT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15243)

After preprocessing and labeling the dataset, a machine learning model needs to be trained to recognize bird species from their sounds. There are several algorithms that can be used for this task, such as support vector machines (SVM), convolutional neural networks (CNN), and recurrent neural networks (RNN).

The choice of algorithm depends on the size of the dataset, the complexity of the problem, and the available computational resources. Once the model is trained, it needs to be tested on a separate dataset to evaluate its performance.

# Deployment
Once the model is trained and tested, it can be deployed for real-world applications. One way to deploy the model is to create a web-based interface that allows users to upload audio files and receive a prediction of the bird species. Another way is to integrate the model into a mobile app that can be used in the field to identify bird species on the go.

# Conclusion
This project provides a valuable tool for bird enthusiasts and researchers who want to automate the process of bird species identification. By collecting a large dataset of bird sounds, preprocessing and labeling the data, and training a machine learning model, we can create an accurate and efficient bird species detection system.
